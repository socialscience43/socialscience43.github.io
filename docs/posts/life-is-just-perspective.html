  <p>
    Good day to whoever may be reading this, and welcome to Social Science 43. Although I have made it my mission to post every Saturday, it has become very difficult. But, after a month, I am back. Thank you for coming to read my article.
  </p>

  <p>
   We all have a different perspective on life, based on our past experiences, thoughts, and our point of view. That is solely why we never seem to completely line up when it comes to opinion. There is hardly ever a true, unanimous decision, because all of our perspectives are different. If you were to randomly pick two people in the world, and ask them the same question, their answers would likely be completely different. For example, the way people think is influenced by what is around them, and what they are exposed to. Someone who lives in a place where a certain ideology is pushed onto them is likely to go along with it, and to not think otherwise. After all, they have no reason to think any other way, because they are never exposed to it.

  <p>
   The main point of this article is this: we give reasonings based on our perspective, yet they exclude the regards of others. The views of other people could be completely different to theirs, whether it’s religion, beliefs, concerns, or morals. Often when people state their case in debates or issues, they use these things based on reasonings specific to their particular group or community. Those are references that have no business in a conversation with someone who is a member of a completely different culture or community. Someone born at a certain time can call someone young or old, yet they will be or were the same at a time. The present will always change, and we will never have control over it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of making our perspectives form a hole in the road, we can find a common ground between what we do share. You can enlighten someone with what you know and are exposed to, but you should also keep an open mind and recognize that your perspective is different from others. You should recognize that what others share is what you can use to help yourself grow and become more aware of the diversity in our world. Thank you for reading Social Science 43, and have an exquisite day.
  </p>
