  <h1>The Opposite Theory</h1>
  <p class="byline"><strong>Social Science 43</strong> ¬∑ October 18, 2025</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúDo not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not.‚Äù<br>
    ‚Äî Epicurus, <em>Letter to Menoeceus</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Good day to all who may be reading this. This week I have decided to do something different from my usual article. I would like you to think about what you desire most in life. Do you have it now, or is it something you want to have? Do you just want it, or do you want to work for it? Certain answers to these questions may seem like dreams, but in every single outcome, you will have struggles. Many of those who were born famous or are famous, wish that they would be ignored for once. Even those who were born special in any way tend to wish they could be normal on some standard. Yet, those who were born out of the spotlight, always want to be famous. Those who were born normal on any standard, wish they were special. What I‚Äôm saying is, we always want what we don‚Äôt have, while forgetting to realize that we have something that others don‚Äôt have.

    As humans, we often forget that what we have is more valuable than anything that we may want. Our own unique characteristics, and past experiences add up to something great. Many say they have regrets, or they would want to go back in time to fix their mistakes. But, if you are trying to improve your life, I guarantee you that you have no regrets. Everything wrong you have done and everything you‚Äôve struggled through has shaped who you are, and who you‚Äôll become. The only relevance of the past in our lives is tradition. There is no reason to regret something from the past, when it ended up leading to you reading this. Because I say that you can control the future, so go and shape your future, and you‚Äôll see that what you may regret is what shaped the greatness of your future. Remember that every improvement comes with an equal hardship, so don‚Äôt do things to make your life easier, because they won‚Äôt. Instead, make life harder where it should be, and easier where it should be. Thank you for reading Social Science 43, and have a productive day.
