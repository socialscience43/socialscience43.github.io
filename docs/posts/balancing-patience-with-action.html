  <h1>Balancing Patience with Action</h1>
  <p class="byline"><strong>Social Science 43</strong> · November 8, 2025</p>

    Having patience is one of the most difficult things for us, because we thirst for our dreams to come true instantaneously. But if we try to lower our standards for the benefit of time, we won’t be satisfied. Obviously, none of your aspirations will come to you if you don’t act first, but being patient plays a major role as well. Remember, though, that patience isn’t just waiting for things to come to you, or waiting for the perfect moment. Patience is knowing when to act, and knowing when to wait. When you balance this with action, you’re no longer waiting for the perfect moment, you’re making the perfect moment. Focus on what is in your hands, because you can set yourself up perfectly if you learn about what you want. And when it comes in your grasp, it will be much easier to catch.

    Patience builds better decision-making. Rushing things will get them done more quickly, but it probably won’t get them done correctly. When you are patient, it will take time, but you will be rewarded by the great results. Don’t let failure fool you, it can only hurt your mindset, not your capabilities. If you ask most anyone to name a United States president, I’m sure they would say either Lincoln or Washington. Yet Abraham Lincoln was defeated so many times in his life, such as losing when he ran for Congress, Senate, state legislature, and Vice Presidency. He lost loved ones, suffered nervous breakdowns, but he was patient. He ended up accomplishing sensational things, and is renowned across the country.

    We find it hard to be patient in difficult situations, because all we want to do is get out. But if you are in the middle of the ocean, the tide will bring you to shore eventually. It could take two months or two years, but you’ll be there eventually. That’s the thing though, you have to help yourself out a little bit too. If you attempt to swim in the right direction, you’ll arrive much quicker. Just don’t wear yourself out, let the tide do its job. Think about how that analogy connects to real life situations. Push yourself in the right direction, but let the world push you back and forth. You’ll reach your goals much quicker. Thank you for reading Social Science 43, and stay patient.
